Java supports three types of comments:

1. Single-line comment:
// This is a single-line comment

2. Multi-line comment:
/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
*/

3. Documentation comment (used for generating Javadoc):
/**
 * This is a documentation comment.
 * It is used to describe classes, methods, and fields.
 */

Example usage in code:

public class Example {
     // This is a single-line comment

     /*
      * This is a multi-line comment
      */

     /**
      * This method adds two numbers.
      * @param a First number
      * @param b Second number
      * @return Sum of a and b
      */
     public int add(int a, int b) {
          return a + b;
     }
}
